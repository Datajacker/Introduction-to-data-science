The key thing to understand here is that text needs to be transformed to a mathematical representation in order for use in a machine learning algorithm. We do that by creating a vector out of each line of text. Each dimension in the vector represents a word; if that word exists in the text that dimension's value is 1, otherwise the value is 0. Don't worry about having to implement this yourself. Here are some sklearn functions you can use in your code. Apply this transformation to your training set before you fit your model:\n","\n","```\n","vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words=\"english\", binary=True)\n","train_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_text)\n","```\n","\n","Something to note is that the vector transformation can only use words that are seen in the training set. This is to simulate a real experiment where you cannot see the test set before it is time to make a prediction. Because of this, you can't \"vectorize\" the whole dataset at once. You need to \"fit\" the vectorizer to the training set and then transform the test set with it before you make you prediction.

First, the model itself. Since our feature representation will be in terms of 1s and 0s, you can use the Bernoulli implementation of Naive Bayes:\n","\n","http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB.html\n","\n","Default parameters should be sufficient. Take a look at the methods offered here. You should already be familiar with `fit` and `predict`. Another one you will need to use is `predict_proba`. `predict` returns 1s and 0s based on a 0.5 threshold. `predict_proba` returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 for each sample. This distinction might sound a little subtle but it is important. When evaluating the classifier, the functions that compute evaluation metrics typically need 1s and 0s as input (so you will want to store the results of `predict`). Our function we will provide for computing the ROC curve needs probabilities as input (so you will want to store the results of `predict_proba`).\n","\n","### Evaluation Metrics\n","\n","Before, we had you print out specific metrics.
