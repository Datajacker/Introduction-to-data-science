Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data â€“ such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision.\n","\"\"\".replace('.','').replace('.','').replace('(','').replace(')','').split()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8PufzlaOD2bp","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
